## Project Summary Description ðŸ’¡ ðŸ’¡ ðŸ’¡ ðŸ’¡ 
Our project revolves around a critical challenge faced by an African telecommunications company. This challenge pertains to customer retention and involves the development of a robust machine learning model. This model serves a crucial purpose â€“ predicting the likelihood of customers churning, or becoming inactive for an extended 90-day period. By providing actionable insights, our solution empowers the company to proactively engage with at-risk customers, ultimately enhancing customer satisfaction and retention strategies.

## Rubrics  ðŸ’¡ ðŸ’¡ ðŸ’¡ ðŸ’¡ 
Our project rubrics follows the **CRISP-DM** (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) framework, providing a structured approach to our solution.

### 1. Business Understanding
- We comprehensively analyze the challenge faced by the African telecommunications company, focusing on customer churn prediction as a key business objective.

### 2. Data Understanding
- We explore and thoroughly understand the dataset, ensuring its relevance and quality for our machine learning model.

### 3. Data Preparation
- We preprocess and clean the data, including feature engineering and handling missing values, to prepare it for model training.

### 4. Modeling
- We employ various machine learning techniques to build predictive models for customer churn, selecting the most effective one based on evaluation metrics such as AUC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve) score.

### 5. Evaluation
- We assess the model's performance using the AUC score, ensuring it meets the project's objectives.

### 6. Deployment
- We discuss the potential deployment strategies for integrating our model into the telecommunications company's operations.

### 7. Conclusion
- We summarize the project's findings and implications, emphasizing its significance in helping the company proactively retain customers.

Our adherence to the CRISP-DM framework ensures a well-structured and effective approach to solving the customer churn challenge.
This section provides a clear outline of how you're approaching the project, following the CRISP-DM framework, and how you'll evaluate the model's performance using the AUC score.

Certainly, here's a more detailed explanation of each step of the CRISP-DM framework:

1. Business Understanding
We thoroughly grasp the problem at hand, delineating the African telecommunications company's challenges and goals. Understanding the business context is essential for developing an effective churn prediction model.

2. Data Understanding
We dive deep into the available dataset, examining its structure, quality, and relevance. This step helps us identify potential data issues and determine the suitability of the data for our analysis.

3. Data Preparation
Data preprocessing is key. We clean, transform, and engineer features to ensure data quality and model readiness. Handling missing values, outliers, and scaling features are some common tasks in this phase.

4. Modeling
We apply a variety of machine learning algorithms, experimenting with different techniques to build predictive models. Model selection and tuning are critical, ensuring the chosen model aligns with project objectives.

5. Evaluation
We assess model performance using metrics such as the AUC score. This step involves comparing different models, fine-tuning hyperparameters, and validating the model's ability to predict customer churn effectively.

6. Deployment
We explore strategies for deploying the model in the company's operational environment. This includes considerations for integrating the model into existing systems and processes.

7. Conclusion
In the final step, we summarize project findings, including the implications of our model for the telecommunications company. We emphasize the actionable insights gained and the value of proactive customer retention strategies.



Part 5 : Fine tune our model
The goal is to: 
-(a) Improve the AUC 
-(b) Have an good eval on zindi challenge
